# [Stardoc](https://skydoc.bazel.build) - Starlark Documentation Generator

Stardoc is a documentation generator for [Bazel](https://bazel.build) build rules
written in [Starlark](https://bazel.build/docs/skylark/index.html).

[bazelbuild/skydoc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/skydoc) repository
 are being moved to this one. Use the
[bazelbuild/skydoc](https://github.com/bazelbuild/skydoc) repository
for the time being.
